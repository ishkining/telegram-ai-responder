# Telegram AI Responder

## About project

Chat with Mario and Einstein is a Telegram bot that lets you interact with two famous characters: the video game hero Mario and the genius physicist Albert Einstein. You can choose which character you want to chat with using a web app that displays their images and personalities. The bot uses chatpgt to generate realistic and engaging responses based on the character you selected. You can also view the analytics of your chat sessions using Amplitude, which shows you what operations are going on inside the code.

## Install packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Chat with Mario and Einstein is easy to use and fun to play with. Here are some of the features you can enjoy:

Choose your character: When you start a chat session with the bot, you will be redirected to a web app where you can see the images and descriptions of Mario and Einstein. You can click on the image of the character you want to chat with, and the bot will switch to that mode.
Chat with personality: The bot will generate responses based on the character you selected, using chatpgtâ€™s natural language generation capabilities. You can ask questions, make jokes, or have a casual conversation with either Mario or Einstein, and they will reply accordingly.
View analytics: The bot will also send you a link to view the analytics of your chat session using Amplitude. You can see how many messages you exchanged, how long you chatted, what topics you discussed, and what operations were performed by the code.
